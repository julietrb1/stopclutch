Stopclutch is a Django application to track race times collaboratively, and offers an API to be used with external applications like ones that read Assetto Corsa times when races finish.

Unfortunately, the README never got written until now (when I'm archiving the repository), so it's here for your exploratory perusal. Enjoy, and have a lovely day ⭐️
